🌟 Name:

"Lisa Melanie" 

📱 Layout + Flow:

Landing Screen:

 A *beautiful background** (maybe animated soft stars or a pastel sky).

 A cute heading: ➔ "A little question for a very special girl...*"

 Button: *"Continue"**

Second Screen:

 You can add a *cute drawing** (like a boy and a girl holding hands, or two cartoon planets smiling at each other 🌍❤️🪐).

 Text: ➔ "You are an amazing person, Lisa. Kind, sweet, and full of sunshine...*" ➔ "*And I feel so lucky to know you.*"

 Button: *"Next"**

Third Screen:

 A heartwarming animation — maybe *flowers blooming**, or balloons floating up.

 Then the main question appears slowly*: ➔ "**Lisa... will you be my friend? 🌸✨**"

* Two buttons:

   *Yes** (cute green color)

   *Of course!** (even cuter pink color)

   *No (when she will try to click, it will show a sad emoji and say please)**

Final Screen (after she clicks):

* Show a cute mini celebration animation (like confetti 🎉 or stars 🌟).

 Text: ➔ "Yay! I’m so happy! 🥰 Thank you for being my friend, Lisa. You’re truly special.*"

 Optional: A button to play a *tiny audio** (you saying "Thank you, Lisa!" in a cute voice).

🎨 Design style:

* Pastel colors (soft pink, blue, white, lavender)

* Rounded buttons

 Soft fonts (handwritten style like Poppins* or Pacifico)

* Animations that are smooth and calming

 Mobile-first (make sure it looks perfect* on her phone screen!)

🔥 Bonus ideas:

 Add *cute sound effects** (like a tiny pop or twinkles✨)

 A *tiny cat** or alien mascot walking around the screen, referencing your inside jokes

 Maybe a secret page where she can see "Why Bashy likes Lisa*" with 3-4 sweet points 🥹
